# Integration
Numerical integration with Simpson and trapezoidal rule
The purpose of this project is determination of the work done by an electric field
when moving an electron from point A(1,2) to B(7,5), as shown in this graph:

We use 4 different type of integration techniques:
- trapezoidal
- Simposon
- composite Simpson
- composite trapezoidal
