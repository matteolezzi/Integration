# Numerical integration with Simpson and trapezoidal rule
The purpose of this project is determination of the work done by an electric field  when moving an electron from point A(1,2) to B(7,5), as shown in this graph:

and the expression of the electric field is: 
 $\ Ax^4e^{-Cx^2} \hat{x} + By^4e^{-Dy^2} \hat{y}$
 , where A is set as $\ 2 V/m^5$ and B is set as $\ 1 V/m^5 $
 
We use 4 different type of integration techniques:
- trapezoidal
- Simposon
- composite Simpson
- composite trapezoidal

and apply them with the use of the ROOT framework
